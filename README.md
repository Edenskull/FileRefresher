# FileRefresher
Google Script to increment file with a certain structure

# How it works

## Introduction
The script is for personal use. It allows you to manually perform a file renaming in a certain directory with a pre-defined nomenclature.

## Setup Usage

### Setup Global Vars
You will need to setup 2 variables in your script project to make the script work:
* folderId : the value should be the folder where your trying to rename files
* prefixNom : the value should be the prefix that you want to put before the increment
